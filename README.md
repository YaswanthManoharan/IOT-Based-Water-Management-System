# IOT-Based-Water-Management-System

Keywords: IoT, Arduino, Ultrasonic sensor, Solenoid valve, sound sensor, flow sensor

This project is all about conserving water at public places. The system proposed in this project, an IoT system for water monitoring and 
control approach which supports internet-based data collection realtime and processing. This can be implemented in highly populated residential buildings like 
hotels, shopping malls, hostels, dormitory, apartments, etc.This system addresses that the flow rate measuring using flow sensor and 
scheming the supply of water in order to minimize the wastage of water by using solenoid valve and approach the water conservation and 
also this project can measure the quantity of water used by every person by using flow rate sensors. 
The proposed system has been planned to use an Arduino controller,and we are sending the data to a webpage for monitoring the water usage and 
some real time alert system using a LCD display and a Buzzer.

Future Progression : Thus our project is all about conserving water in public places such as restaurants, malls, theatres, public toilets, schools, colleges, etcâ€¦ 
The future progression of this proposed project is that, this project can be made more accurate by using a camera module instead of ultrasonic sensor and 
it can be programmed in such a way to monitor the water usage activity of people and the data can be collected, studied for future purposes. 
In the Backend part the water consumption analysis (updation of Volume used) can be extended to the next level such as studying the volume of water consumed and 
making a report on it and also alerting the conserved person if the usage exceeds a limit. The usage of many components can be minimised 
if one implements  the same idea with ML based technique such as using only a camera module to detect and analyze both water wastage (water dropping from the tap) and 
activity of people and alert them if it meets the usage constraints.

Highlights : We have also created a Webpage to monitor the Volume of water Consumed Periodically using Socket in VSCode.
